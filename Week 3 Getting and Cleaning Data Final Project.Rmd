### README for 'run_analysis.R'

This repository contains an 'R' script file (`run_analysis.R`) that performs various data processing tasks. The script aims to download and process the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The following sections provide an overview of the steps involved and the purpose of each section.

## Getting Started

To run the script, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Download the HAR dataset file and place it in the directory `data` folder.
2. Unzip the downloaded file to extract the dataset.
3. Run the script (`run_analysis.R`) in your preferred 'R' environment.

## Data Processing Steps

### Step 1: Get the Data

The script begins by downloading the HAR dataset file from a specific URL and saving it to the RStudio directory `data` folder. The downloaded file is then extracted.

### Step 2: Read Data from Files

The script reads various files from the dataset, including the activity files, subject files, and features files. Each file is loaded into a separate dataframe for further processing. The dimensions and structure of the dataframes are displayed for verification.

### Step 3: Merge Dataframes

The script merges the training and test sets by combining the individual dataframes. The resulting dataframe includes subject, activity, and features data. Descriptive variable names are assigned to the merged dataframe.

### Step 4: Extract Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements

In this step, the script extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each variable. The subset of features with names containing "mean()" or "std()" is selected, resulting in a modified dataframe.

### Step 5: Use Descriptive Activity Names

The script reads descriptive activity names from a file ('activity_labels.txt') and maps them to the corresponding activity codes in the dataframe. This step ensures that the activities in the dataset have descriptive names.

### Step 6: Label Variables with Descriptive Names

Variable names in the dataframe are modified to be more descriptive. The script replaces specific prefixes and abbreviations with meaningful terms. A final check is performed to ensure all variable names are descriptive and well-grouped.

### Step 7: Create Tidy Data Set

The script aggregates the modified dataframe to create a second, independent tidy data set. The aggregation is performed based on the grouping variables `subject_ID` and `activity`, calculating the mean value for each variable within each combination. The resulting tidy data set is then sorted by `subject_ID` and `activity`.

### Step 8: Store the Tidy Data Set

The final tidy data set is saved as a text file named `FinalProjData.txt` in the `data` folder.

## Conclusion

The 'run_analysis.R' script provides a comprehensive workflow to download, process, and aggregate the HAR dataset, resulting in a tidy data set. It follows a series of steps, from data acquisition to generating the final tidy dataset.

Please note that this README file provides an overview of the script's functionality. For detailed information and a step-by-step guide, refer to the comments within the 'run_analysis.R' script itself.

### Data Types of the 'cleaned' tidy dataset are: 

1. subject_ID - integer (1 - 30)
2. activity - factor with 6 levels (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
3. thru 68. all time domain and frequency domain measurements  - numeric

### Units (of each measurement) of the 'cleaned' tidy dataset are:

In general, accelerometer measurements are commonly reported in units of gravity (g) or meters per second squared (m/s²). Gyroscope measurements are typically expressed in degrees per second (°/s) or radians per second (rad/s).

It should be noted, however, that in this dataset: 
======
- Features (measurements) are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

### Transformations or Calculations done to obtain the 'cleaned' tidy dataset : 

The variables that are derived from others or involve specific transformations or calculations; details;

In developing the 'FinalProjData' tidy dataset, we were assigned the goal to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The original dataset we were assigned to use is the Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

We transformed the original HAR dataset as follows:

   1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      (below gives information about how the merging was done; we merged the original training (X_train, y_train) sets and the          test (X_test, y_test) sets to create one dataframe).
       We used the 'rbind' function to combine the individual dataframes by rows, e.g., for the HAR X_train and y_test                'features' data: "Featur_Dat <- rbind(Featur_Train, Featur_Test)".
       
       We merged columns to get the data frame data for all data ('subject', 'activities', 'features').
       We used the 'cbind' function to combine the individual dataframes by columns, e.g., 
       for the "Combin_Dat <- cbind(Subject_Dat, Activ_Dat)". Then formed a data frame 'InterimData' :
       "InterimData <- cbind(Combin_Dat, Featur_Dat)".
       
       Note: at this point we had a data frame 'InterimData' which is an accumulation of all of the original HAR                        measurements as well as their calculated 'mean values' and 'standard deviation values'.

   2. Then we extracted only the values on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      For the extraction of mean and standard deviation measurements, we 'Subset' names of Features by                                 measurements on the mean and standard deviation i.e., take the Names of Features with “mean()” 
      or “std()”. 
      
      Note: 1st we used the 'grep' function. The 'grep' function is used for pattern matching and
      searching within character strings or vectors. It returns the indices or elements that match a specified
      pattern; e.g.' "MyData_Featur_Nam <- colnam_Featur_Dat[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", colnam_Featur_Dat)]".
      
       Then, In doing the above, in the 'MyData_featur_Nam' feature names, we are left with only those                                  measurement names which are described by both their mean AND standard deviation _which, I understand, is
       what we were asked to do in the directions for this assignment._

       NOW we are ready to 'subset' the dataframe InterimData by seleted names of Features;
       "MySelected_Nam <- c(as.character(MyData_Featur_Nam), "subject_ID", "activity" )"; 
       then 'subset InterimData' as "InterimData <- subset(InterimData, select = MySelected_Nam)".
       
       By veiwing the subsetted 'InterimData data frame', we see we are left with only those Features which give
       
       the 'mean()' and 'std()' of the variables.


   3. Gave descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set; 
      To elaborate on the specific mapping of original activity labels to the descriptive names used in the
      cleaned dataset:  
   
      To begin, we needed to 'read' descriptive activity names from “activity_labels.txt” USING
      
      "activ_Labels <- read.table(file.path(path_HAR, "activity_labels.txt"),header = FALSE)".
      
      Then we: 1) created the mapping between activity codes and names using 'activ_Labels'; i.e.,
      
      "activity_mapping <- data.frame(code = 1:6, name = activ_Labels$V2)"
      
      and 2) factorized the 'activity' variable with descriptive names; i.e., 
      
           "InterimData$activity <- factor(InterimData$activity, levels = activity_mapping$code, labels =                                      activity_mapping$name)"

          Then checked to see the proper 'activity labels';
            "head(InterimData$activity, 30)"                       
            ....and we see proper labels.....

   4.  Now, label the data set with 'descriptive' variable names.
       Previously, the variables 'activity' and 'subject' and names of the activities have been 
        labelled using descriptive names.

       So, also, the names of the 'Features' were labeled using descriptive variable names.
         1st we looked at the 'InterimData Features' again to see what we needed to change: 
         a. prefix t is replaced by time
         b. Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
         c. Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
         d. prefix f is replaced by frequency
         e. Mag is replaced by Magnitude
         f. BodyBody is replaced by Body
            
            We used 'global substitution' i.e., the 'gsub' function to replace abbreviations with the full 
            word in the InterimData data frame variable names: 
              e.g., we used "names(InterimData) <- gsub("^t", "time", names(InterimData))".
              
   5. From the data set in step 4 (above), created a second, independent tidy data set with the 'average' of 
      each variable for each activity and each subject: 
      
      I interpret this to mean, that we are taking the 'mean' of the Means and the 'mean' of the Standard Deviations -- So            below, a second, independent tidy data set is created::
   
  
      In the below, 'FinalData_1' performs aggregation on the 'InterimData' dataframe using the 'aggregate' function from the         base R package.

      The 'aggregate' function is used to aggregate data based on the grouping variables 'subject_ID + activity': 
      This indicates that the aggregation should be performed based on the variables 'subject_ID' and 'activity'. It groups the       data by these variables.
      
      Furthermore, in the below, the 'mean' function is specified as the aggregation function. It calculates the mean value for       each variable within each combination of 'subject_ID' and 'activity'.
      'aggregate' is from dplyr; "library(dplyr)"; 
      we form data frame "FinalData_1 <- aggregate(. ~subject_ID + activity, InterimData, mean)".
      
      We then 'ordered' Final Data_1 to form data frame; 
     "FinalData <- FinalData_1[order(FinalData_1*dollar sign*subject_ID, FinalData_1*dollar sign*activity), ]"
     
      The 'order' function is used to sort vectors or data frames based on one or more variables.It returns a permutation that        rearranges the elements of the input object in ascending order by default, or based on a specified order. We see that we        have the data sorted by each subject (subject_ID) in ascending order. 
      
      Finally, we stored 'FinalData' in my directory (as tidy data frame 'FinalProjData');
      
      "write.table(FinalData, "./data/FinalProjData.txt", row.name = FALSE)"
      
      
      
**_FinalProjData_** is a 'data.frame' with 180 observations (rows) of  68 variables (columns). It is sorted by each subject's ID by each activity they performed (6 level factor ; WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). Each row represents the mean (or average) of the 'means' and 'standard deviations' of time domain and frequency domain accelerometer and gryroscope measurements for each activity for each participant (subject).
